Hooks ----> 
  Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to
  use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions
  which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It
  does not work inside classes.
                            Hooks are backward-compatible, which means it does not 
 contain any breaking changes. Also, it does not replace your knowledge of React concepts.
