What Is Controller --> Controller is The Central unit of any MVC Based Framework. It Controller Everthing Like
                   DB Html Etc .


Cretae A Controller --> php artisan make:controller UserController # Controller name 

  Goto app/http/controllers/  


   Now Create A Function To Print Anthing 

    function show(){
        return "Hello Returned From Controller"
    }

    Now We Need To Create Rout to load This (Like Url set in django)

    To Do routes/web.php In Laravel 7 We Don't Need To Import This Controller But Now We Need to Import This Controller 

    use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;  Use This To Import 

    use This 

    Route::get("userlogin",[UserController::class,"show"]);

    In laravel 7 This code is Used 

    Route::get("userlogin",'UserController@show');



Now To Pass Data From Url

   Route::get("userlogin/{id}",[UserController::class,"show"]);

   function show($id){

        return $id;
    }

    To Retrive Data
