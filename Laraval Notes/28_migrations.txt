test Project -->  ex_migration

 Migration Means Same Like Django --> 

 Now We Want To Create A Table emp

 1} Create Directly         2} Using Migrations


 Create a Tbale using Migration Command -->

 -------------->  php artisan make:migration create_tablename_table


 Now it Should Create Suussfully 

 Now Suppose If You Want TO Add New Coloun TO This Tbale Goto 

 database\migration\ last vala 

 By Default id And Timestamp Will Be Automatically Created 

            $table->id();//default created 

            $table->string('name'); //by us
            $table->string('mobno');
            $table->string('password');

            $table->timestamps();//default created 


Until Now It Does Not Created In DataBase So -->


To create it In Database

    ----> php artisan migrate

    it Does Not Work If Your Version Is Low So Download Latest Version Or Use Xamp Server latest Version


Toutorial Part 2 

    php artisan make:migration create_tablename_table 

    php artisan migrate //To Migrate Everthing

    php artisan migrate:reset //It Going To reset Everything Means Delete Database Table Created By Laravel

         It Will Never Imapact Your Manually Created Tables

         It You Want Just To Remove Lasted Created Data And Migrations 


    php artisan migrate:rollback //just reset last migration

    php artisan migrate:rollback --step 3 //it just removelast three migrations


    php artisan migrate:refresh // if you have added New Filed Then You Use This Command To Do

       if You Want To Migrate A Specific Table 

    php artisan migrate --path=/database/migrations/2021_04_07_033007_create_test2_table.php

    php artisan migrate:refresh --path=/database/migrations/2021_04_07_033007_create_test2_table.php
