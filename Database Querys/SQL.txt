DBMS -> Database management system . in this data is stored as file such as XML ,
        Wndows registery . Relationship bwterrn two table or file are managed by
         programatically

RDBM -> Relational Database management system is the data stored as a tabular form and And We Can 
         manage relation when creating tables . 

Database Query -> 

    1} CREATE DATABASE DB_NAME; 
       to create a new database;

    2} SHOW DATABASES;
       List all the databases;

    3} DESC TABLES_NAME;
        Describe tables details;

    4} SHOW TABLES;
       List all tables in the database;

    5} DROP DATABASE_NAME or TABLE_NAME; 
    to Delete a database or table

    6} CREATE TABLE User ( user_id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
     username varchar(250) , fullname varchar ( 350),
      PRIMARY KEY(user_id)) ;

      CREATE a table in db ;By default, the starting value for 
      AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.
      To let the AUTO_INCREMENT sequence start with another value, use the following
       SQL statement:

    ALTER TABLE User AUTO_INCREMENT=100;

    7} INSERT INTO User ( username , fullname) values ("SAHARSHm","saharsh solanki");

CLAUES -> Clauses are in-built functions available to us in SQL. With the help of clauses, 
        we can deal with data easily stored in the table. Clauses help us filter and analyze data
        quickly. When we have large amounts of data stored in the database, we use Clauses to
         query and get data required by the user.

SQL -> Stands for Structured Query Language is a standrized programing language 
       that is used to manage relational databases and perform  various operation in them 
       it is create in 1970's 

JOIN -->  A Join Clause is used to combine two or more rows of diffrent tables , basesd on 
         a related column on them 
     
    Example -> Suppose we have two Tables User ( Contains info of user ) and Order  ( Contain )
               History of order by default we use INNER JOIN

    Syntext = > SELECT * FROM Orders INNER JOIN Users on User.user_id  = Orders.user_id ;
    
    To select specific fields Orders.orderId, User.username, User.fullname, Orders.order_type

    Different Types of SQL JOINs _>

    1} (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables 
         
         In the prevoious example we have use inner join 

    2} LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from 
    the right table
    
    Syntext : SELECT Orders.orderId, User.username, User.fullname, Orders.order_type FROM User LEFT JOIN Orders on User.user_id  = Orders.user_
               id ;

    3} RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    
      Syntext :  SELECT Orders.orderId, User.username, User.fullname, Orders.order_type FROM User RIGHT JOIN Orders on User.user_id  = Orders.user_id ;

    4} FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
