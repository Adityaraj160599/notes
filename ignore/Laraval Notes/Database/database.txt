 2} Using Model



   1} By DB :--->

    To use This

    Now 

      function  index(){
	        return DB::select("select * from userdata");
	    }

  2} By Model :--->

  first create a model --> php artisan make:model modelname 

     use App\Models\User;

     Import this 


      function  index(){

		    public $table="userdata";
		}
