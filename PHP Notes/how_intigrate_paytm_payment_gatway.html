Now After Submit form like ( in ecomerce website pay by paytm  ) When User Click On This Button We Have To Redirect user to this file pgRedirect with order_id now ( The Best Way To Do is Insert all details like name address email txn_AMOUNT time product_id etc in database and then and make status == pending  And 

   	Now     $ORDER_ID = $order_id; =============Order_id ALwas Unique
			$CUST_ID = "CUST001";==========  // CUstomer_id
			$INDUSTRY_TYPE_ID = "retail"; ====Reatail etc
			$CHANNEL_ID = "WEB";         -=======
			$TXN_AMOUNT = $amount;       

			This Variable Sholud BE Pass In The PgRedirect.php 

After Passing This Variable We Have One more

$paramList["CALLBACK_URL"] = "http://".$hst."/charge/recharge.php";

After Payment is successfull or failed paytm will redirect us to this page with parameters like order_id , txn_status etc 

And if Payment is successfull we can update status = paid to this order_id or Success or if paytm txn_status is failed update status 
to faildb to this order_id 






Now We Have One More File Called txnstatus.php we have that file check the txn_status with order-id We Need TO Pass the order_id To This file and we can check wthere the tcn is faield success
